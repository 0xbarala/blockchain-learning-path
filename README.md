# Blockchain Learning Path

An opinionated learning path for getting into speed with Blockchain (specially Ethereum). This is a
work in progress, please open an issue or send a pull request to help improving it.

## Pre-requisites

Besides a programming background, this path assumes that the reader is at least a little comfortable
with:

- Public key cryptography
- Digital signatures
- Cryptographic hashing

## Bitcoin

1. Read [How the Bitcoin protocol actually works](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/).
2. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) (lighter than the previous
article but useful to solidify your knowledge).

## Ethereum

1. Read [How does Ethereum work, anyway?](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369)
2. Read [this article](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05)
on smart contracts development.
3. Read Truffle's [Pet shop tutorial](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop)
4. Read the [Truffle Documentation](http://truffleframework.com/docs/)
5. Learn Ethereum development by making a [Zombie Game](https://cryptozombies.io/)
6. Read the [Web3 Documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/)

**TODO** Add some resource to learn the differences between the bitcoin and the ethereum blockchains.
